F:I'm a lumberjack 
And I'm O.K 
I sleep all night 
And I work all day

A: He's a lumberjack 
And he's O.K 
He sleeps all night 
And he works all day

F: I cut down trees 
I eat my lunch 
I go to the lavatory 
On Wednesday I go shopping 
And have buttered scones for tea

A: He cuts down trees 
He eats his lunch 
He goes to the lavatory 
On Wednesday he goes shopping 
And has buttered scones for tea 

He's a lumberjack 
And he's O.K 
He sleeps all night
And he works all day

F: I cut down trees 
I skip and jump 
I like to press wild flowers 
I put on women's clothing 
And hang around in bars

A: He cuts down trees 
He skips and jumps 
He likes to press wild flowers 
He puts on women's clothing 
And hangs around in bars

He's a lumberjack 
And he's O.K 
He sleeps all night 
And he works all day

F: I cut down trees 
I wear high heels 
Suspenders and a bra 
I wish I'd been a girlie 
Just like my dear Papa

A: He cuts down trees 
He wears high heels 
      (spoken rather than sung)
Suspenders ..... and a bra? 
That's shocking! 
That's rude...tuttut...tut...tut
