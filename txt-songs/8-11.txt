When I get drunker

<melodi>
When I'm 64

<text>
When I get drunker, loosing my mind
many beers from now.
Will I still be having me a jolly good time,
whisky, gin and a bottle of wine.
So, fill up the glasses, drunk as a skunk,
don't say you want no more,
'cause we are the singers
and we are the swingers,
join us and you won't get bored.
