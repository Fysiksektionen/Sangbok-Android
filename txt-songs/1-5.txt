<titel>Auld lang syne


<text>Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And days o' lang syne?
For auld lang syne my dear,
For auld lang syne,
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne. 

And there's a hand, my trusty friend,
And gie's a hand o' thine
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne.
For auld lang syne my dear,
For auld lang syne,
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne.
